# Mobile Development Setup with Expo Go

## Objective
Mobile development requires more computational resources compared to traditional web development. To simplify and streamline the development process, we are using the **Expo Framework** for React Native.  
Expo provides tools for rapid mobile app development and testing, enabling us to run apps directly on physical devices without relying heavily on device emulators.

---

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure the following are installed and ready on your system:
- **Node.js LTS**
- **VS Code** (recommended IDE)
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows  
- **Physical Device**: Android or iOS phone with internet access  

---

## Why Expo Go?
Traditional mobile app testing depends on emulators, which require significant system resources and may not reflect the full range of devices available in the market (e.g., iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android devices).  

**Expo Go** solves this by:
- Allowing direct app testing on your physical device.  
- Supporting both iOS and Android platforms.  
- Removing the need for expensive hardware or emulator setups.
